LAMPLITE - A MOODLE 2.0 THEME

Lamplite has been created by Richard Oelmann based on the hard work of many other Moodle contributors

The Lamplite theme is essentially a customisation of Patrick Malley's Serenity theme.
To this basic theme, I have pulled in the profile block from Shaun Daubney's Aardvark theme series.
I have also added in the coding for Moodle2 custom menus from the Moodle 2 Themes documentation.

Given that I have 'played with' the various bits of php and css linked to all these sections I would also point out that any errors are my own!!!

I would also like to acknowledge the support and advice of Mary Evans through the Moodle Themes forum
